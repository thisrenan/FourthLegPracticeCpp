This list of exercises refers to C++ programming studies and corresponds to the first part of the study.

The list involves matrix manipulation and programming logic.

# Welcome to the Fourth C++ Practice

Lets practice what we have been studying.

1. Develop an algorithm that reads a 5 x 5 matrix, calculates and prints the sum of all its values.

2. Write an algorithm that performs the following tasks with 3 x 5 matrices of integers:
   
   a. Read a matrix A.
   
   b. Read a matrix B.
   
   c. Generate a matrix C with the sum of the elements of matrix A and B.
   
   d. Show all the elements of row 2 of matrix C.
   
   e. Show all the elements of column 3 of matrix C.

3. Develop a program that fills a 5 x 5 matrix (using random selection) and then identifies the largest element of the matrix. Display the result.

4. Write a program that reads a 4 x 4 matrix and then adds up all the elements contained in the main diagonal. Display the result.

5. Write a program that reads a 4 x 4 matrix and then adds all the elements contained in the secondary diagonal. Display the result.

6. Write a program that fills a 5x5 matrix using random numbers. Then create two vectors and place, in one, the sum of the matrix rows, and in the other the sum of the matrix columns. Display the result.

7. Develop an algorithm that reads a set of integers that will be stored in a matrix A with dimensions 10x10. From matrix A, the program must generate a vector with the largest elements of each row and another vector with the smallest elements of each column.
