This list of exercises refers to C++ programming studies and corresponds to the first part of the study.

The list involves matrix manipulation and programming logic.

# Welcome to the Fourth C++ Practice

Lets practice what we have been studying.

1. Develop an algorithm that reads a 5 x 5 matrix, calculates and prints the sum of all its values.

2. Write an algorithm that performs the following tasks with 3 x 5 matrices of integers:
   
   a. Read a matrix A.
   
   b. Read a matrix B.
   
   c. Generate a matrix C with the sum of the elements of matrix A and B.
   
   d. Show all the elements of row 2 of matrix C.
   
   e. Show all the elements of column 3 of matrix C.

3. Develop a program that fills a 5 x 5 matrix (using random selection) and then identifies the largest element of the matrix. Display the result.
